<!-- EXAMPLES OF USAGE: Examples showing how to use the project -->
## Examples of Usage
Here's an example of how to set up the basic server and test the API:

```javascript
// Initialize the server
// User Login
fetch('/api/login', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ email: 'user@example.com', password: 'securepassword' })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log('JWT Token:', data.token));
```

Example of caching trip data with Redis:
```javascript
const redis = require('redis');
const client = redis.createClient();

app.get('/api/trips', async (req, res) => {
    client.get('trips', async (err, data) => {
        if (data) {
            res.json(JSON.parse(data));
        } else {
            const trips = await Trip.find({});
            client.setex('trips', 3600, JSON.stringify(trips));
            res.json(trips);
        }
    });
});
```
